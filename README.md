# NEAT-Jet-Simulation

## Jet AI Navigation with NEAT in Unity

This project implements a NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) neural network to control an AI-driven jet in Unity. The AI navigates through waypoints while optimizing its path using sensor inputs and rewards for alignment and efficiency. This project explores the application of evolutionary algorithms to complex navigation tasks.
